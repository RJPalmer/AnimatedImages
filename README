Created AnimatedImages - A simple web page that switches images with a click of a button using HTML5 canvas and javascript/jQuery.

What's Next - Using a timer, a method will called after an interval of time to switch the images. 
Requirement:
  Timing
	Images
	Image swapping

Hypothesis:
	Given two images, image1 and image2. We created a displayImage to show on the canvas. The timer will call a swapMethod every so often to switch the source location of the displayImage from image1 to image2 and vice versa.
